Fluid Mechanics for Engineers
=============================

This book provides an introduction to fluid mechanics for engineers. There are many books on fluid mechanics. Here are some of the reasons why this one is special:
- It's free!
- Interactive
    - Code for plots and demonstrations is available and can be modified.
    - Dynamic demonstrations are provided within this book to build intuition and enhance learning.
    - The online tools used allow seemless integration of video, web links, and a structure that is much more flexible than the standard linear start-to-end presentation of standard textbooks.
- Open source.
    - Want to change the order of the chapters? Easy, just edit the table of contents and rebuild the book, everything will stay consistent.

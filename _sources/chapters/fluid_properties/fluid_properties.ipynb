    "The density $\\rho$ of a fluid is the mass of the fluid per unit volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Density is a point property in the sense that to get mass we have to multiply $\\rho$ by some volume. If the density is spatially uniform, we have $m=\\rho V$. For a differential volume element $dV$, we have $dm = \\rho dV$, and the mass over some finite volume can be evaluated by integration:\n",

    "<!--todo: add pictures for variable rho, and pointwise >> molecular spacing -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In using the density this way in Eq. {eq}`eq:m_rho`, we are implicitly assuming the contiuum assumption holds. That is, all spatial variations in the density are at scales much larger that molecular sizes and spacings.\n",

    "### Units\n",
    "Common units of $\\rho$ are \n",
    "* kg/m$^3$\n",

    "### Ideal gases\n",
    "The ideal gas law is commonly written as $PV = nR_gT$. We rearrange this to $n/V = P/R_gT$, which is moles per volume. Multiplying both sides by the mean molecular weight M of the gas gives\n",

    "The viscosity $\\mu$ of a fluid is a measure of the resistance to flow. Higher viscosity fluids have higher flow friction and are more resistant to deformation. Honey has a high viscosity compared to water. See {numref}`fig:viscosity_demo` for a simulation illustrating two fluids of different viscosities.\n",

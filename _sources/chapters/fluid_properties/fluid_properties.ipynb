    "## Density\n",
    "\n",
    "The density of a fluid is the mass of the fluid per unit volume. \n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol $\\rho$ is typically used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density is a point property in the sense that to get mass we have to multiply $\\rho$ by some volume. If the density is spatially uniform, we have $m=\\rho V$. For a differential volume element $dV$, we have $dm = \\rho dV$, and the mass over some finite volume can be evaluated by integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:m_rho\n",
    "m = \\int_V \\rho(\\mathbf{x})dV.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--todo: add pictures for variable rho, and pointwise >> molecular spacing -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In using the density this way in Eq. {eq}`eq:m_rho`, we are implicitly assuming the contiuum assumption holds. That is, all spatial variations in the density are at scales much larger that molecular sizes and spacings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideal gases\n",
    "The ideal gas law is commonly written as $PV = nR_gT$. We rearrange this to $n/V = P/R_gT$, which is moles per volume. Multiplying both sides by the mean molecular weight M of the gas gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\frac{MP}{R_gT}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Table {numref}`tab:fluid_densities` gives densities for several fluids. Note that the difference in density between air and water is nearly a factor of one thousand. This allows important assumptions and simplifications in some calculations. This is illustrated in {numref}`fig:air_water_vol_comparison`\n",

    "Density is a point property in the sense that to get mass we have to multiply $\\rho$ by some volume. If the density is spatially uniform, we have $m=\\rho V$. For a differential volume element $dV$, we have $dm = \\rho dV$, and the mass over some finite volume can be evaluated by integration:\n",

    "In using the density this way in Eq. {eq}`eq:m_rho`, we are implicitly assuming the **contiuum assumption** holds. That is, all spatial variations in the density are at scales much larger that molecular sizes and spacings. For example, air is mostly nitrogen $\\ce{N2}$ which has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_diameter\" target=_blank>kinetic diameter</a> of 3.64E-10 m. In nitrogen gas at 298 K and 1 atm, there are 2.46E25 molecules per m$^3$. This gives a distance between molecules of approximately 34E-10 m. The distance between molecules is about ten times the size of the molecules. These distances are usually much smaller than flow scales in a fluid, so we assume the fluid is a continuum, without explicitly considering its molecular structure. In liquids, the intermolecular spacing is even smaller, and is similar to the molecular size.\n",

Demonstrate this by computing the diameter of a sphere of water for which the weight of the sphere equals the surface forces around the circumference of the spere.\n",

    "Pressure is an important property in fluid mechanics. Pressure is a force per unit area normal to a surface\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\frac{F}{A}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The SI unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa), with Pa $\\equiv$ N/m$^2$. In U.S. Customary Units (USCU), pressure is given by pounds-force per square inch (psi). Note that pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector, so the force $F$ in the above equation represents the magnitude of the force normal to the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure is easier to define and visualize in terms of the force on a surface, but pressure exists throughout a fluid without a physical surface present. We can consider two adjacent fluids with an imaginary plane between them. The fluid on one side exerts a force on the adjacent fluid in the same way that the fluid exerts a force on a solid surface. This arises from molecular collisions in the fluid. The fluid-fluid interactions are the same regardless of how the plane is oriented because the molecular motions at a point don't have any preferred direction. We say, then, that the pressure is **isotropic**, that is, independent of direction. This is consistent with the pressure being a scalar instead of a vector.\n",

    "$$P = \\frac{nRT}{V},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is moles, $R$ is the universal [gas constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_constant), $T$ is absolute temperature, and $V$ is volume. $n/V$ is a molar density or *concentration*, which is proportional to the number of molecules per unit volume. The molecular speed is proportional to temperature. Hence, the pressure increases as both the molecular speed increases, and as the concentration of molecules increases. That is, pressure is higher when the molecules strike \"harder\" and strike more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the pressure in a fluid changes from one location to another, and depends on fluid velocity and the depth of the fluid. The effect of fluid depth is discussed in {ref}`chap:fluid_statics`.\n",

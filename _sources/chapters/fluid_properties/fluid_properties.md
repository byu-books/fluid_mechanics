# Fluid Properties

## Density

The density of a fluid is the mass of the fluid per unit volume. 

The symbol $\rho$ is typically used.

Density is a point property in the sense that to get mass we have to multiply $\rho$ by some volume. If the density is spatially uniform, we have $m=\rho V$. For a differential volume element $dV$, we have $dm = \rho dV$, and the mass over some finite volume can be evaluated by integration:

```{math}
:label: eq:m_rho
m = \int_V \rho(\mathbf{x})dV.
```

<!--todo: add pictures for variable rho, and pointwise >> molecular spacing -->

In using the density this way in Eq. {eq}`eq:m_rho`, we are implicitly assuming the contiuum assumption holds. That is, all spatial variations in the density are at scales much larger that molecular sizes and spacings.

### Ideal gases
The ideal gas law is commonly written as $PV = nR_gT$. We rearrange this to $n/V = P/R_gT$, which is moles per volume. Multiplying both sides by the mean molecular weight M of the gas gives

$$\rho = \frac{MP}{R_gT}.$$

Table {numref}`tab:fluid_densities` gives densities for several fluids. Note that the difference in density between air and water is nearly a factor of one thousand. This allows important assumptions and simplifications in some calculations. This is illustrated in {numref}`fig:air_water_vol_comparison`

### Specific gravity
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_density" target="_blank">Specific gravity</a> is density divided by a reference density, usually water at 4 $^o$C which has a density of 1000 kg/m$^3$. That is
```{math}
:name: eq:sg
SG = \frac{\rho}{\rho_\text{H2O}}
```
Table {numref}`tab:fluid_densities` shows SG values for several common fluids.
